                I'm a Frontend Developer with a passion for building websites that are both functional and visually engaging. Skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I specialize in creating responsive, user-friendly interfaces that adapt seamlessly across devices.
Alongside coding, I also explore graphics design, which allows me to add creative elements and bring extra polish to the projects I work on. My goal is simple: to turn ideas into digital experiences that are clean, modern, and enjoyable to use.

                    <h3>Note to Future Self</h3>
                    <p>
                        Dear Future Me,<br> Remember why you started to grow from curiosity into confidence. Every challenge 
                        you face now is shaping the developer you are becoming. Keep asking questions, keep breaking things ( and fixing them), and never loos the exictement of learning something new.
                        When things get hard look back and see how far you've come from figuring out basic layout to building complete responsive applications. Keep aiming higher, keep refining 
                        your craft, and stay humble enough to learn from anyon around you.
                        The goal isn't to learn everything but to keep improving everyday.<br/><br>
                        -from your present self, still learning, still building.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>

                    <h3>Extra Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>
                        This internship feels like more than just a learning period, it is a chance to 
                        test everything i've been studying and see how it applies in real projects. i want
                        to stay curious, ask questions often, and learn not just how to build things but how
                        to build them the right way.
                        <br>
                        I know i still have a lot to improve, but that's exactly what makes this experience exciting.
                        Each task, bug and review is part of the process that will shape me into a more confident and efficient 
                        front-end developer. My focus is on progress over perfection.
